# AI_USAGE_GUIDE

This file provides specific instructions for using the AI system with focus on tasks and workflows for code quality and security. Use this guide to explore and apply the system's features accurately.

## Toolchain System Overview

This system employs GitHub Actions workflows to streamline tasks related to code quality and security. This section details:

- **Code Quality Assurance**: The workflow ensures that all pushes and pull requests automatically validate the code before merging.
- **Security Scanning**: This is achieved using `bandit`. It identifies potential security risks in the code.
- **Code Formatting**: Using `black` ensures style consistency across the repository.
- **Test Coverage**: With `pytest-cov`, the system measures test coverage and validates functionality.

### Workflow Execution

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in the repository.
2. Select the workflow titled **Code Quality, Security Scan, and Coverage**.
3. Click **Run workflow** to execute it manually, or wait for it to trigger on new pushes or pull requests.

## Key Features

- **Dependabot Enabled**: Automatic updates to dependencies are managed to ensure the repository stays current and secure.
- **LSTM Model Enhancements**: Apply AI insights into tasks like preprocessing data, validating workflows, and analyzing codebase trends.
