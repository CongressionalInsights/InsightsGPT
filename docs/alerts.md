# Alerts

This section displays the latest JSON alerts generated by the CI process.

*Note: This page will be automatically updated. If you see no alert data, it means the CI process hasn't populated them yet or there was an issue.*

## Alert Data

Currently, this page is a placeholder for displaying JSON alert data.
The method for fetching and displaying JSON content will depend on the CI output and desired formatting.
It might involve:
- A script to convert JSON to markdown tables.
- Direct embedding if the JSON is simple and readable.
- Linking to raw JSON files.

<!-- Placeholder for script/logic to list/display alerts -->
<!-- Example: Raw content from an alert file might be displayed in a code block, or linked. -->
