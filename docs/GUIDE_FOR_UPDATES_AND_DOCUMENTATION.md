# Guide for Updates and Documentation

This guide provides a framework for adding new functionality (scripts, workflows, etc.) to the **InsightsGPT** repository. Follow these steps to ensure consistency across the repository.

---

## Step 1: **Plan and Build**

1. **Define Objectives**:
   - What does the new functionality achieve (e.g., new script, workflow, or API integration)?
   - How will it interact with the existing repository?

2. **Choose Appropriate Structure**:
   - **Scripts**: Add Python scripts to the `scripts/` folder.
   - **Workflows**: Add YAML files to `.github/workflows/`.
   - **Data Outputs**: Save outputs in appropriate folders (`data/`, `datasets/`, `alerts/`, or `visualizations/`).

3. **Code Standards**:
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
   - Include comments and docstrings for clarity.
   - Add error handling and logging where necessary.

---

## Step 2: **Integrate into Workflows**

1. **Determine Workflow Needs**:
   - Should the new functionality run on specific triggers (e.g., commits, schedule)?
   - Is manual triggering required?

2. **Create or Update Workflows**:
   - Use `.github/workflows/` for new workflows.
   - If updating an existing workflow, ensure backward compatibility.

3. **Test Workflow**:
   - Validate the YAML configuration.
   - Run the workflow in a test branch to confirm functionality.

---

## Step 3: **Update Documentation**

1. **Update `README.md`**:
   - Add a brief overview of the new functionality (script or workflow) under the appropriate section.
   - If outputs are generated, document where they are saved and how to use them.

2. **Update `docs/scripts_overview.md`**:
   - Include a detailed entry for new scripts:
     - **Purpose**: What does the script do?
     - **Inputs**: Required arguments.
     - **Outputs**: Where results are saved.
   - Example entry:
     ```markdown
     ### `new_script.py`
     - **Purpose**: Describe functionality.
     - **Inputs**: Command-line arguments.
     - **Outputs**: Generated files or logs.
     ```

3. **Update Workflow Documentation**:
   - Include new workflows in `docs/USAGE_GUIDE_FOR_AI.md`.
   - Document triggers, expected outputs, and usage examples.

4. **Update Changelog**:
   - Add a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md`:
     ```markdown
     ## Version X.X.X
     - Added `new_script.py` to handle [functionality].
     - Introduced workflow `new-workflow.yml` to automate [task].
     - Updated documentation for [details].
     ```

---

## Step 4: **Testing and Validation**

1. **Test Scripts**:
   - Run locally and validate outputs.
   - Confirm that inputs are flexible and error handling works.

2. **Test Workflows**:
   - Use a feature branch to test new or updated workflows.
   - Verify outputs and logs.

3. **Validate Documentation**:
   - Ensure added sections are accurate and consistent.
   - Test provided examples in the documentation.

---

## Step 5: **Ensure Scalability**

1. **Modular Design**:
   - Avoid hardcoding API-specific functionality. Use dynamic inputs for flexibility.
   - Organize outputs into structured folders.

2. **Compatibility**:
   - Check if new additions impact existing workflows or scripts.
   - Ensure backward compatibility unless breaking changes are documented.

---

## Standard Directory Structure

- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for API interactions, validation, visualization, etc.
- **`data/`**: Raw JSON files fetched from APIs.
- **`datasets/`**: Filtered and processed datasets.
- **`alerts/`**: Flagged results from keyword monitoring.
- **`visualizations/`**: Generated charts and summaries.
- **`.github/workflows/`**: CI/CD workflows for automation.

---

## Example Workflow for Adding New Functionality

### 1. Add a Script
- File: `scripts/new_script.py`
- Description: Describe the purpose of the script.
- Inputs: List required arguments (e.g., `--input_folder`, `--output_folder`).

### 2. Add a Workflow
- File: `.github/workflows/new-workflow.yml`
- Trigger: Define triggers (e.g., on push, schedule).
- Steps: Include setup, script execution, and output handling.

### 3. Update Documentation
- `README.md`: Briefly describe the new functionality.
- `docs/scripts_overview.md`: Provide a detailed explanation of the script.
- `docs/USAGE_GUIDE_FOR_AI.md`: Document workflow details and usage examples.

### 4. Test and Finalize
- Test locally and on a test branch.
- Review all documentation for completeness.
- Merge to the main branch after validation.
