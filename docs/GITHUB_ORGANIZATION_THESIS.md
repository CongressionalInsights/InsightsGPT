# GITHUB ORGANIZATION THESIS

This document provides an overview of the repository structure and how all the components fit together sothat they work both independently and synergistically.

...

Major Components:
- *"scripts/*": Contains all the core scripts for interacting with congressional and regulational data. each file provides logics and error handling.
- *"docs/*": Non-code reference files including guides, contributions, and structured metadata to help users and contributors.
- *".github/workflows/*": Specifies and implements for testing, wiring, and deploying code.

...

How They Work:
- The *scripts* directory interacts with Regulations.gov, Senate.gov, and other internal apis. They work independently to provide data, analysis, and visualizations.
- The *docs* directory provides non-code resources for context and overark. They are designed to increase the flow of information and collaboration.
- The *.github/workflows** area is designed to ensure productivity through automated tests, deployment, and continuous integration.

...

A larger Symphony:
 - The repository functions as part of a larger architecture. Specific components provide external functionality to support the core value of data and user analysis. The balance of code complexity, contextual documentation, and collaboration enables users to easily interact with the full system.
