## Interactive Legislative Dashboard

This project includes an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit to explore legislative data.

### How to Run the Dashboard

1.  **Navigate to the Repository Root:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the root directory of this repository.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/repository-root
    ```

2.  **Ensure Dependencies are Installed:**
    The dashboard relies on `streamlit`, `plotly`, and `pandas`. These and other necessary packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    It's recommended to do this within a virtual environment.

3.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    Once in the root directory and with dependencies installed, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run scripts/dashboard.py
    ```

4.  **View the Dashboard:**
    This command will typically open the dashboard automatically in your default web browser. If it doesn't, your terminal will display a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) that you can copy and paste into your browser's address bar.

    You should see the "Legislative Data Dashboard" with filters in the sidebar and placeholder charts in the main panel. As development progresses, these will be populated with real data and interactive features.
