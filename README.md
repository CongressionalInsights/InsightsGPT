## **How It Works**

InsightsGPT integrates data from three key government sources:

1. **Congress.gov API**
   - Provides legislative data, including bills, amendments, nominations, and committee reports.
   - Example Use Case:
     - *Track amendments to a bill and their outcomes.*

2. **FEC API**
   - Offers detailed campaign finance data, including contributions and expenditures.
   - Example Use Case:
     - *Analyze donations to a candidate by location.*

3. **Regulations.gov API**
   - Gives access to regulatory dockets, public comments, and federal rules.
   - Example Use Case:
     - *Examine public sentiment on proposed regulations for artificial intelligence.*

## **Usage Examples**

### Query a Billâ€™s Details:
```python
from insights_gpt import CongressAPI

congress_api = CongressAPI(api_key="your_congress_api_key")
bill_details = congress_api.get_bill_details(congress=118, bill_type="hr", bill_number=3075)
print(bill_details)
```

### Analyze Campaign Contributions:
```python
from insights_gpt import FECAPI

fec_api = FECAPI(api_key="your_fec_api_key")
receipts = fec_api.get_itemized_receipts(contributor_name="John Doe", cycle=2024)
print(receipts)
```

### Explore Public Comments:
```python
from insights_gpt import RegulationsAPI

regulations_api = RegulationsAPI(api_key="your_regulations_api_key")
comments = regulations_api.list_comments(search_term="Artificial Intelligence", page_size=10)
print(comments)
```
